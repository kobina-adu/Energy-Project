# Energy Project
 A smart grid represents the future of energy distribution. It integrates digital technology and automation to monitor, predict, and manage electricity flow efficiently. The project aims to use Python to simulate a smart grid system that optimizes power distribution by predicting demand and supply, allocating resources dynamically, and integrating renewable energy sources.
